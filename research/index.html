		<h2>My work in graduate school</h2>
		<p>Imagine an abstract system composed of numerous species occupying a common region of space. Now, allow for these different species to interact with each other and their surroundings in a rich variety of ways&mdash;by the mutual application of forces, transforming into one another through chemical reactions, transferring energy amongst themselves&#8230; to just about anything else you care to study.</p>
		<p>This is exactly what we have done, focusing our thought experiments on the materials and biophysical phenomena pertinent to the development of biological tissue. Drawing from the mathematics of continuum field theory, we have derived an abstract theoretical framework, general enough to encompass, systematically describe and study much of the biophysics underlying the growth of tissues.</p>
		<p>But that's not where this story ends!</p>
		<p>While abstract frameworks are all well and good for the soul, in order to arrive at something truly useful, we have proceeded to implement much of our theory into a general purpose computational framework&mdash;allowing us to solve a variety of interesting problems in applied science:</p>
