		<h2>A tale of two formulations</h2>
		<p>It is common in the literature to start with the <em>Laplacian formulation</em> of the Navier-Stokes equations,</p>
		<p>		  
		  \begin{align}
		  \mathrm{div}(v) &= 0  \\
		  \rho \frac{\partial v}{\partial t} + \rho \left(\mathrm{grad}(v)\right)v &= -\mathrm{grad}(p) + \mu\; \mathrm{lap}(v)\;,
		  \end{align}
		</p>
		<p>when going about deriving numerical methods to simulate viscous flow. When considered in this strong form, the above formulation is equivalent to the following <em>divergence formulation</em> arising from continuum mechanics:
		<p>
		  \begin{align}
		  \mathrm{div}(v) &= 0  \\
		  \rho \frac{\partial v}{\partial t} + \rho \left(\mathrm{grad}(v)\right)v &= \mathrm{div}(\sigma),
		  \end{align}
		</p>
		<p>where, for our Newtonian fluid, \(\sigma = -p\; I\ + \mu\; \left(\mathrm{grad}(u) + \mathrm{grad}(u)^{T} \right)\).</p>
		<p>Even though these two points of view are equivalent in the strong form, there are a few things one should keep in mind in practice. When integrated by parts to construct a weak form suitable for the finite element method, the two formulations above return different Neumann boundary terms. The divergence formulation introduces a boundary term with the traction, \( \sigma\; n \), whereas the <em>Laplacian formulation</em> introduces a term with the normal derivative of the velocity, \(\frac{\partial u}{\partial n}\). This means:</p>
		<p>1. You probably want to pick the formulation based on the kind of boundary conditions you wish to impose. e.g., If you are considering a fully-developed channel flow, you know that there is a pressure and an (unknown, non-zero) shear stress at the outlet. Since you cannot set an unknown stress condition, the natural choice for this case is the Laplacian formulation with conditions \(\frac{\partial u}{\partial n} = 0 \) and \( \int p = 0 \). On the other hand, if you were considering free surface flow, you need to set the traction at the surface to a known value (usually 0). In this case, the divergence formulation is the logical choice.</p>
		<p>2. You need to be aware of the subtleties involved with impementing the Laplacian formulation, or you may end up <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/fld.1480">violating objectivity</a> (as this formulation does not introduce the notion of a symmetric Cauchy stress).</p>
		<p>3. You must pay attention to how you implement boundary conditions, otherwise you will not see the flow you want.</p>
