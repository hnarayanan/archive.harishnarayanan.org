		<p>Cancer is a collective term for a class of diseases that are a leading cause of death worldwide. The World Health Organization reports that in 2007 alone, 7.9 million deaths (about 13% of all deaths worldwide) were the result of various kinds of cancerous tumours. The development of a tumour is a complex phenomenon whose immediate cause is that some specific cell type has managed to overcome the usual regulatory signals of the cell cycle to grow, proliferate and live beyond its normal, programmed range. These rapidly proliferating, diseased cells proceed to invade surrounding tissue and later spread to other organs in a process called metastasis, which is often fatal.</p>
		<p>The processes that drive the growth and development of tumours are numerous and intricately coupled, but the fact that they can be posed in physical and mathematical terms allows them to be carefully studied through computer simulation. This proposed project will further our understanding of these underlying processes through the creation of a computational model specifically tailored to simulating the tumour growth problem. Experimental observations from our collaborators and from the literature will be used to guide modelling choices and validate the computations. The resulting computational model will then be used to examine in silico specific questions related to the growth of solid tumours embedded in soft tissue.</p>
		<p>The primary impact of such a study would thus be to improve the understanding of the biophysical processes driving tumour growth, potentially aiding in the search for effective treatment protocols. An important auxiliary contribution of this research comes in the form of the freely distributed software toolkit that will be created to solve the equations arising from modelling the tumour growth problem. Focussing on accessibility and incorporating sufficient generality, the proposed toolkit will allow other researchers to easily modify modelling assumptions and answer additional scientific questions. This greatly widens the scope for impact of the project.</p>
