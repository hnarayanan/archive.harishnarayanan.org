		<p>Nonlinear elasticity theory plays a fundamental role in modelling the mechanical response of many polymeric and biological materials. Such materials are capable of undergoing finite deformation, and their material response is often characterised by complex, nonlinear constitutive relationships. Because of these difficulties, predicting the response of such materials to arbitrary loads requires numerical computation.</p>
		<p>The steps involved in the construction of the required numerical algorithms are classical and straightforward in principle, but their application to non-trivial material models are typically tedious and error-prone. <a href="https://launchpad.net/cbc.solve/"><em>CBC.Twist</em></a> is our attempt to alleviate this problem.</p>

		  <p><a href="https://launchpad.net/cbc.solve/">CBC.Twist</a> is an automated computational framework for nonlinear elasticity based upon the finite element method. The framework aims to allow researchers to easily pose their problems in a straightforward manner, so that they may focus on higher-level modelling questions, without being hindered by specific implementation issues. It is built atop <a href="http://fenics.org/">the FEniCS project</a>, and is collaboratively developed <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">free software</a>. We&#8217;d love for you to <a href="https://launchpad.net/cbc.solve/">try it</a> and tell us what you think!</p>

<!-- (which is not yet closed, since it does not distinguish one material -->

<!-- syntax (in Python) that closely resembles how it is written down on -->
<!-- paper. Then, leveraging the automatic linearisation capabilities of -->
<!-- the underlying software framework, we will see how one can easily pose -->
<!-- sophisticated material models purely at the level of specifying a -->
<!-- strain energy function, also using high-level Python syntax. The -->
<!-- underlying framework performs the linearisation and generates -->
<!-- efficient (C++) code for the finite element computation. Subsequently, -->
<!-- information about the computational domain, (Dirichlet and Neumann) -->
<!-- boundary conditions, and time-stepping details are each introduced -->
<!-- using a few lines of high-level code, completing the specification of -->
<!-- the initial- boundary-value problem for nonlinear elasticity. The talk -->
<!-- will close with increasingly complex applications of the computational -->
<!-- framework. -->
