		<p>Accurate and efficient modelling of biomedical flows is of substantial interest because of its immediate applicability to a variety of fields, including the design of medical devices, the planning of surgical procedures and most fundamentally, the scientific understanding of healthy and diseased biological function. The complexity in this problem arises from the fact that physically-interesting flows occur in complex, patient-specific geometries and often occur in conjunction with other physics such as the finite deformation of the vascular walls and biochemical reaction-diffusion processes.</p>
		<p>The primary aim of our research is the development of a robust computational framework for biomedical flow simulation. Central to this development are adaptive mesh techniques based on <em>a posteriori</em> error estimates which rely on estimates of the errors of physical quantities of interest (goal quantities) to determine regions where the residual needs to be reduced. These estimates are calculated from the computed solution and the solution of an auxiliary (dual) problem containing information about the stability of the flow equations being solved and the goal quantities.</p>
		<p>To make these concepts more concrete, let us take a look at one of our applications of interest: understanding how blood flow in an artery affects the formation and growth of aneurysms. Such a problem motivates the need for accurate computation of quantities which are implicated in the growth of aneurysms (such as the shear forces exerted by the blood flow on their vessel walls and the stretch of the arterial walls due to normal pressure). Applying our adaptive Navier-Stokes scheme to this problem results in the construction of optimal computational meshes to compute these quantities related to aneurysm growth to a specified accuracy requirement with minimal work.</p>
