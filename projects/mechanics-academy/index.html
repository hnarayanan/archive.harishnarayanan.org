		<p>I love to teach. I&#8217;ve been <a href="<!--#echo var="MY_DOCUMENT_ROOT"-->/writing/harmonising-whistleblowing/">repeatedly told</a> I&#8217;m a good teacher. I greatly enjoy making websites. I don&#8217;t know why it took me so long to connect these dots, but from that recent connection was born <a href="http://mechanicsacademy.org/">Mechanics Academy</a>.</p>
		<p>Mechanics Academy is a website for disseminating university-level lectures on topics I care about. These primarily include continuum mechanics theory, its application to mathematical biology and the numerical methods involved in solving the equations arising from the theory. The effort is greatly inspired by how much I&#8217;ve learnt from other virtual learning projects around the web. Prominent examples of these are <a href="http://www.khanacademy.org/">Khan Academy</a>, MIT&#8217;s <a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/">OpenCourseWare</a> and Stanford&#8217;s <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/class/cs193p/cgi-bin/drupal/">iPhone Application Development</a>, <a href="https://www.ai-class.com/">Artificial Intelligence</a> and <a href="http://www.ml-class.org/">Machine Learning</a> classes. Each of these projects serve their respective niches very well, and Mechanics Academy hopes to be a similarly valuable resource for university students aiming to learn mechanics.</p>
