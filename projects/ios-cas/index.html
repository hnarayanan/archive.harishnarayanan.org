		<p>One of the first things I did upon getting an iPhone last year was to fork over an additional $99 to <a href="http://developer.apple.com/">developer.apple.com</a>, to get access to their iOS development tools and the right to run my own apps on my phone. This has been exciting because programming for the phone has involved learning a lot: a whole new programming paradigm, touch-based UI design, a new programming language and a host of new APIs.</p>
		<p>It is in the midst of all this manic learning that I started working in earnest on my first iOS app: an as-yet unnamed computer algebra system. Its backend symbolic algebra engine is powered by <a href="http://www.ginac.de/">GiNaC</a> and frontend equation renderer is <a href="http://code.google.com/p/mathjax-ios/">MathJax</a>. While the core functionality has been in place for some time now, I am still trying to arrive at an intuitive user interface. If you have any ideas and are interested in contributing to my efforts, please get in touch!</p>
