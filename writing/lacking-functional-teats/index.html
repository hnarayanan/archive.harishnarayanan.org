	        <p>No matter how much you&#8217;re concerned for your friendly neighbours and would love to give them an evening off; don&#8217;t give-in to the urge to volunteer baby-sitting their baby&#8212;especially if the (now-not-so-)darling little angle is progressing through the final stages of her teething phase; or you don&#8217;t know what  you&#8217;re doing.</p>
		<p>Whatever you do, if in the process of baby-sitting her, she spits up into your tee, let it go. You can change later. Really, it&#8217;s no big deal.</p>
		<p>As you begin to change&#8212;after gingerly giving-in to lowering her for a bit and keeping her in plain sight&#8212;whatever you do, put on another shirt before returning to her; even if she&#8217;s begun to <em>wail</em>. Really, it doesn&#8217;t take more than five seconds.</p>
		<p>Whatever your &#8220;instincts&#8221; tell you, do not cradle the wailing baby to your exposed chest while attempting to console her. No, really. Presenting a decoy, non-functioning teat to a baby with tiny (but surprisingly effective) teeth is just asking for it.</p>
		<p>But it&#8217;s not like you&#8217;d ever get yourself into such a situation now, would you?</p>
