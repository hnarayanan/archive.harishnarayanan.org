		<p>During a recent flight, I came across, arguably, the hottest mom <em>ever</em>; and I really mean that superlatively so. She was barely in her 20s, had a gorgeous face, soft-flowing hair, was super slim with a teeny waist and yet oh-so curvy. She had the tiniest shirt on and the tightest jeans riding down to her mid-thighs, cutely exposing her purple-string bikini.</p>
		<p>But, I really wasn&#8217;t paying attention.</p>
		<p>I, was generally cooing, peek-a-booing and gurgling throughout the journey, as I was having fun with my new <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=single-serving+friend">single-serving friend</a>. She was gleefully cuddling up in my arms and bouncing away excitedly on my lap; and her serenely-happy, somewhat-tired glow later indicated that she was as pleased with this bonding as I was. Now, it was time for her sippy-cup filled with orange juice.</p>
		<p>You must realise, of course, that I am speaking of the woman&#8217;s most adorable little few-year-old girl. You know, the kinds with a smile that can melt a glacier or three? Yes, one of those kids.</p>
		<p>As I was getting off, this other woman&#8212;also arguably (superlatively) cute&#8212;approaches me all-excitedly (and gurgley!) and tells me that she&#8217;d observed me playing with &#8220;my little one,&#8221; and found us adorable together. She then animatedly began to talk to me, using words implying that she was thoroughly impressed, somewhat amused and quite entertained.</p>
		<p>I am unsure who was sadder as I was informing her that she wasn&#8217;t <em>my</em> little one.</p>
		<p>Sigh.</p>
