		<p>It wasn&#8217;t hard to understand the confused glances I was receiving from Elaina on the couch across my coffee table. As clearly as I&#8217;d explained to the lady I&#8217;d spoken to when I called the escort service that I wasn&#8217;t looking for sex, that information hadn&#8217;t been relayed to the timid East-European woman staring bewildered at me upon hearing the question I&#8217;d just presented.</p>
		<p>&#8220;You heard me right, my dear, I&#8217;d like to take you out,&#8221; I continue to push. &#8220;What kinds of things do you do for fun?&#8221;</p>
		<p>I&#8217;d assumed it ought to be possible. After all, she was from an escort service; and all I was asking of her was to escort me somewhere, anywhere she fancied. Without seeking too much pity, I briefly chronicled to her the social handicap I was attempting to overcome. I believed I&#8217;d gotten through; hoping that interacting with her over a delightful dinner, or shopping for fancy shoes together, or ridiculing the production values of the cheesy movie we&#8217;d just watched, or anything else, really, would provide me a relatively anxiety-free opportunity to carefully observe&#8212;and hopefully make sense of&#8212;how a woman responds to varying social cues. Like I tried explaining to her, &#8220;&#8230; to get a handle on the social dynamics associated with dating.&#8221;</p>
		<p>But it wasn&#8217;t to be.</p>
		<p>Her top faded soon thereafter, along with her timorous demeanour.</p>
