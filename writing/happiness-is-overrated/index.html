		<p>So here&#8217;s what I just realised: I&#8217;m in an unfulfilling relationship. It took me a long time to arrive at that conclusion, and, quite frankly, I&#8217;m still not certain whether I can clearly articulate what the problem is. But here&#8217;s me trying.</p>
		<p>I&#8217;ve come to realise over the course of my existence that happiness and sadness, levels of prosperity or contentment and a host of other things are just states of being. As hard as society has tried to condition me into thinking otherwise, I firmly believe that none of these states are inherently better or worse than any of the others. They&#8217;re all little more than strokes in the rich canvas of life; some cheerful and colourful, others deep and morose. And as with any masterpiece that isn&#8217;t doused with pretty pastel shades, a life needn&#8217;t be filled with joy and contentment for it to be meaningful, moving or even beautiful.</p>
		<p>I don&#8217;t see why more people don&#8217;t see this. Why is there a constant quest for happiness and prosperity and popularity? What&#8217;s wrong with knowing fully well who you are and what you have&#8212;and being fine with everything, including how you feel about it?</p>
		<p>Now, I&#8217;m generally a very negative person. (But you already knew that.) I don&#8217;t see it as a problem, and I don&#8217;t want to fight to change it. And this brings us back to what I was trying to say in the first place. I&#8217;m in a relationship where I&#8217;m never allowed to be morose without incident. I can&#8217;t be bitter or sarcastic, nor can I say mean things about the world which I feel has denied me so much. I can&#8217;t peacefully sit in a corner and mope, nor can I hold conversations where I repeatedly bring up past mistakes or revisit bad memories.</p>
		<p>But guess what, all that stuff&#8212;the queasy feeling that comes in my tummy from all that stuff&#8212;feels <em>right</em> to me. I don&#8217;t want to constantly talk only about positive things. I don&#8217;t want to plan for and &#8220;fix&#8221; any of these things in the future. I don&#8217;t even want to fucking smile sometimes. I just want to be who I be, and not have the conversation topic turn toward the one thing I dread the most: Women and their insecurities. How she doesn&#8217;t feel adequate. How she&#8217;s not pretty enough to satiate me anymore. How she&#8217;s not a wonderful enough aspect of my life to make me cheery.</p>
		<p>A man can&#8217;t just be melancholic anymore and have it be nothing to do with another.</p>
