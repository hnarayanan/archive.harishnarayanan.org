		<p>&#8220;Do you like me as a girl?&#8221;</p>
		<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; I muttered back in surprise to meet her tired, blue eyes staring softly at me. As I continued to gawk mutely, she gracefully knelt beside me on the couch to elaborate on her question. &#8220;Well, it&#8217;s clear you really like me as a friend. Do you like me as a girl?&#8221;</p>
		<p>Of course I did! Did she think I&#8217;d have invited her home so quickly after getting introduced, and stayed up all night talking about anything and everything if I didn&#8217;t?</p>
		<p>I am not entirely sure how it all began.</p>
		<p>A close friend of a close friend, it was inevitable that I&#8217;d stumble upon her at one gathering or another and we&#8217;d get to talking. I think it was the evening we&#8217;d all been out to the neighbouring comedy club. The comedienne was mediocre, and my mind had begun to wander. I was drawn to the softness of her eyes and the genuineness of her smile from the instant I noticed her. Her dirty blonde hair, parted and held in place with a cute, purple clip&#8212;much like a young girl would have worn it&#8212;was framing her face and exposing her expressive eyes behind her chic glasses. The way her nose crinkled every time she tried to adjust them without touching them was adorable!</p>
		<p>Everything about her screamed a serenity and a positivity that fascinated me, and I soon braved myself to approach her. Before long, we&#8217;d retreated from the group to walk along the pier close by, so that we could focus just on each other.</p>
		<p>I remember the smell of the cold ocean breeze hitting my face. I don&#8217;t recall anything I said, but I can&#8217;t forget how easy it was saying it. That&#8217;s been one of the most wonderful things about being with her. Her ability to let you know she genuinely cares about what you have to say: listening, empathising, sharing; without judging. The words escaping her moist, pink lips are ever cheerful, soothing and supportive. You know those people who&#8217;re born with innate abilities that make their career choices almost beyond question? I don&#8217;t think it will surprise anyone who talks to her for a few minutes to hear that she&#8217;s a psychologist.</p>
		<p>Parting that evening felt incomplete, but I didn&#8217;t think she felt the same way. I was wrong. The next morning, I woke to an e-mail fondly reminiscing the things we&#8217;d shared, and sharing some more. How she&#8217;d felt challenged by me, and how that was a very good thing. It was clear we had so much more to say to each other, and we decided to meet again as soon as we could. After a few days apart, where annoying real life responsibilities&#8212;like that lecture I needed to prepare for&#8212;got in the way, we found ourselves together at a park. No other friends this time to overwhelm me, just us.</p>
		<p>What began at that park in the late afternoon transitioned to my humble abode around midnight. It was early in the morning when she asked me the question; her tired eyes beckoning me for a response.</p>
		<p>I wanted to scream out the obvious answer: &#8220;Of course! Of course I really, really like you.&#8221; But I didn&#8217;t. My mind wasn&#8217;t prepared for the candidness of her question and it stalled, suddenly nervous, needing to think it through. After a brief, awkward pause, I composed myself and answered it in a strange manner. An honest answer, but still very strange. I don&#8217;t know where it all came from&#8212;all those probabilities and percentages and all that talk about not being able to open up so much to her if she were a boy instead. I went on an on, talking in circles for what seemed like an eternity until I finally felt I&#8217;d blown it and asked, &#8220;That wasn&#8217;t the right answer, was it?&#8221;</p>
		<p>&#8220;There isn&#8217;t a right answer or a wrong one,&#8221; she reassured me. &#8220;I wanted to know what was going through your mind, and I felt comfortable enough to just come out and ask you. I knew you&#8217;d be brave enough to give me a thoughtful answer.&#8221;</p>
		<p>I&#8217;d told her earlier my pantry was bare, and she now suggested we leave to go find breakfast. Quite certain now that Iâ€™d blown it, I started to tremble; I spent minutes tying my laces which normally take me seconds. As I was kneeling on the floor fumbling with my shoes, I remarked, &#8220;I am not going to turn the question around on you. But I am going to ask you why you asked me.&#8221;</p>
		<p>&#8220;Because I didn&#8217;t want to do something indecent,&#8221; she sighed softly as she stepped closer beside me. &#8220;Indecent? Whatever do you mean?&#8221; I egged her on, half-smiling now as I slowly rose. She met my smile with her own. &#8220;Like this,&#8221; she cooed as she raised herself on her tippy toes and kissed me.</p>
		<p>It&#8217;s amazing how easy it is to be with someone who&#8217;s cheery and doesn&#8217;t need reassuring.</p>
