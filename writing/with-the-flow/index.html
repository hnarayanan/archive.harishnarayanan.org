		<p>While most people imagine themselves &#8220;navigating their way through life,&#8221; I envision myself standing rather inert, allowing life to flow past me. As with a lot of other things in this world, I find it pointless to question why this is so, and instead just acknowledge that things are the way they are.</p>
		<p>As far back as I can remember (which, arguably, isn&#8217;t very long), I cannot recall making any significant decision with any degree of surety or conviction; I seem to just lie there as eventualities take their course, and the decision is conveniently made for me. (And no, choosing just the right caffeinated beverage from the plethora of delicious choices from the nearby vending machine does not count.) Be it my academic choices, or choosing parts of the world in which to pursue them, to determining what kinds of relationships I engage in, with whom, or for that matter, even when those relationships dissolve&#8212;the sorts of decisions that ought to shape the core of my existence&#8212;I find myself more as a passive observer of events unfolding rather than an active participant in the intricate tapestry.</p>
		<p>If you think about it though, this in itself really isn&#8217;t a bad scheme of events&#8212;as long as one&#8217;s happy with the way things evolve. And therein lies the unfortunate twist in our tale: Recently, I&#8217;ve been hating everything in the picture. And what&#8217;s worse, I seem to have gotten so used to sitting back and allowing things to &#8220;fall into place,&#8221; I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;m even capable of weaving the fabric of my own life any more.</p>
