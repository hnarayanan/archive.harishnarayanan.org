		<p>As a participant of a workshop on <em>Communicating Scientific Research</em> (conducted by Prof. Michael Alley and Melissa Marshall from Pennsylvania State University, March &amp; May 2009), I had the opportunity to have a talk of mine critiqued. Going through the process was personally beneficial to me, and I came away with the following recording of the talk that I gave. The recording also contains critique from the audience, and I am putting it up here in the hope that it will be of interest or help to others.</p>
		<p>This talk was on an adaptive algorithm suitable for biomedical flows, and was geared toward a general scientific audience.</p>
