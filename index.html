		<p>Harish Narayanan received his joint doctorate degree from the Department of Mechanical Engineering and the Scientific Computing Program at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor in late 2007. Since some time in 2008, he has been a post-doctoral researcher at the Center for Biomedical Computing at Simula Research Laboratory.</p>
		<p>At Simula, Dr. Narayanan's work usually falls within the space spanned by the following axes:</p>
		<ul>
		  <li>Analysis of numerical methods toward robust, error-controlled flow solvers.</li>
		  <li>Computational fluid-structure interaction, employing (1), with application to cardio-vascular flows and growth of aneurysms.</li>
		  <li>Continuum-scale multi-species modelling of tissue mechanics and development, employing (1) and (2).</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Other peripherally-related interests of his include:</p>
		<ul>
		  <li>Classical and modern field theories of mechanics.</li>
		  <li>Modern geometry and its ties to physics.</li>
		  <li>Large scale, high performance computing.</li>
		</ul>
